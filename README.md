CodTech Internship – Task 4: Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension
As part of the CodTech Internship, Task 4 required the development of a Chrome Extension that functions as a Productivity Tracker. The core objective of this project was to create a browser-based tool that helps users manage their time efficiently, reduce distractions, and improve daily focus through detailed analytics and control mechanisms. The task also involved building a backend using the MERN stack to store data, manage user preferences, and allow synchronization across devices.

Objective of the Project
In an age where people spend countless hours on the internet — often unknowingly — this project aims to empower users with insights into their browsing habits. The Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension automatically monitors the time spent on websites, blocks access to distracting sites, and generates daily productivity reports. The MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack was chosen for its flexibility and real-time data-handling capabilities, especially useful for syncing user data between devices.

Tools and Technologies Used
1. Chrome Extension Development Tools
Manifest v3: The latest manifest version required by modern Chrome extensions to define permissions, scripts, and UI elements.

JavaScript: Used for developing the logic that monitors tab usage, tracks site visits, and interacts with the background scripts.

HTML/CSS: Used for designing the extension’s popup UI and dashboard interface.

2. Frontend Framework
React.js: Used to build a modern, interactive productivity dashboard that displays analytics, charts, and user preferences.

3. Backend & API
Node.js: Runs the backend logic and API services to connect the extension to the database and sync across devices.

Express.js: Provides RESTful API routes for storing and retrieving time logs, blocked sites, and reports.

4. Database
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user preferences, activity logs, and historical usage data. It is ideal for flexible schema storage and fast querying.

5. Other Tools
Chart.js: Used to visualize productivity data such as time distribution on websites.

VS Code: The main editor platform used for development due to its extensions, Git integration, and productivity features.

Git & GitHub: Version control was managed using Git, and the source code was uploaded to GitHub for collaboration and backup.

How the Extension Works
Website Time Monitoring:
The background script in the extension detects when tabs are opened and records the duration the user spends on each site.

Blocking Distracting Websites:
Users can enter a list of distracting websites (e.g., YouTube, Instagram), and the extension automatically blocks access during focus hours by redirecting or displaying a motivational message.

Daily Productivity Reports:
At the end of each day, a report is generated showing:

Total time spent online

Productive vs. unproductive time

Time breakdown by category (work, entertainment, social media)

Syncing Across Devices:
When a user logs in from another device, all preferences and activity logs are synced from MongoDB through the Node.js API, ensuring continuity.

Applications and Use Cases
Students: Helps in focusing on study sessions by blocking entertainment sites and showing study vs. leisure time.

Remote Workers: Improves work-from-home efficiency by monitoring productivity hours and blocking distractions during work time.

General Users: Useful for building digital discipline and self-awareness about browsing habits.

Challenges Faced
Managing background processes in the Chrome extension to ensure accurate tracking.

Implementing real-time syncing without data duplication.

Ensuring the extension complied with Chrome’s latest security and privacy policies (Manifest V3).

Conclusion
The Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension built during Task 4 is a powerful tool that blends browser automation, data analytics, and user-centric design. By integrating it with a full-fledged MERN backend, the project achieved seamless real-time tracking and personalization across devices. This task not only strengthened my skills in Chrome Extension development and MERN stack programming but also gave me valuable insight into solving real-world productivity problems with technology.
